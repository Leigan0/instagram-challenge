## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## User Stories

* As a user, so I can advertise my life, I would like to be able to post a picture
* As a user, so I can explain my picture choices, I would like to be able to add a caption to a picture
* As a user, so I can feedback on peoples pictures, I want to be able to add a comment to picture posts
* As a user, so people know I posted the picture, I want my username to be added to my post
* As a user, so I can save time, I want to be able to login in using my existing social media account details
* As a user, so I really get the Instagram feel, I want the webpage to look like Instagram
* As a user, so I can save time, I want to be able to add a like to a picture
* As a user, so I can add a category to my picture, I want to be able to add a hashtag
* As a user, so I can search for similar pictures, I want to be able to filter pictures by hashtag


## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
gem "rubocop", "0.48.1"
gem "rubocop-rails"
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!
